# Blender

**Blender** is a [free and open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)[3D computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics) software tool used for creating [animated films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation), [visual effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_effects), [3D models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_modeling), [motion graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_graphics), [virtual reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality), and, formerly, [video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game).<sup id="footnote-1-backlink-1">[[1]](#footnote-1)</sup>

This repository contains my 3D models made in Blender.

I used to have a dozen or so, including a couple short animation loops, but the files were corrupted and I couldn't recover them after getting a new computer, so I'm starting this repo from scratch now! ^^;
